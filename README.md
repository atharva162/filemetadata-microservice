# File Metadata Microservice

###    User stories:
1. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. When You submit something, you will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading with NodeJs I have used the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
